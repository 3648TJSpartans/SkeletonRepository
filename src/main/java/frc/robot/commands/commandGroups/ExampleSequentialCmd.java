/*
 * Command groups can be used to chain multiple commands together.
 * For example, if you want to move one motor, then drive somewhere,
 * then move another motor (as shown in this example), you can use 
 * command groups to do so.
 * 
 * This command group is sequential, which means the first command
 * finishes, and then the next one starts. Other command groups, like
 * parallel groups, in which two commands are both executed simultaneously,
 * can be used as well.
